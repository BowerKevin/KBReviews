                    A majority of the information is sourced from:
                     https://radiohead.fandom.com/wiki/Radiohead and

                     --}}
                    <p> Radiohead is an English rock band formed in Ablingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985.
                        Radiohead's
                        experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Formation</h3>
                    <p>In 1985, the members of now called Radiohead, formed On a Friday, the name
                        referring to
                        the band's usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. On a Friday began recording
                        demos and
                        performing in Oxford. As the band continued to perform live, record labels and producers became
                        interested. Shortly thereafter, On a Friday, signed a six-album recording contract with
                        EMI, a
                        British record label owned by Universal Music Group. At the request of EMI, the band changed
                        their name; "Radiohead" was taken from the song "Radio Head" on the Talking Heads album <em>True
                            Stories</em> (1986).</p>

                    <h3>1992-1994: Early success</h3>
                    <p>Radiohead released their debut release, the <em>Drill</em> EP, it was released in 1992,
                        and performed poorly. A year later the band released "Creep", this single started to receive
                        attention in the British music press, not all favourable. "Creep" was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1
                        because it was too "depressing".</p>
                    <p>In February 1993, the band released their debut album,<em> Pablo Honey</em>. It reached number 22
                        in the UK charts, yet critics dubbed the album "a hideous mistake". In early 1993, the band
                        began to attract listeners elsewhere. "Creep" rose to number two on the US modern rock chart
                        and entered the lower reaches of the top 40 pop chart.</p>

                    <h3>1995-1998: Critical acclaim</h3>
                    <p>Radiohead released their third album, <em>OK Computer</em>, in May 1997. The album found
                        the band experimenting with song structures and incorportating ambient, avant-garde, and
                        electronic influences, prompting <em>Rolling Stone</em> to call the album a "stunning art-rock"
                        tour de force. Critics began comparing their work to Pink Floyd. Needless to say <em>OK
                            Computer</em> received critcal acclaim. Yorke said he was "amazed it got the reaction it
                        did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off
                        was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres
                        we were trying to create".</p>
                    <p><em>OK Computer</em> was Radiohead's first number-one UK chart debut, and
                        brought commerical
                        success globally. The band went on to win their first Grammy Award, winning Best Alternative
                        Album and a nomination for Album of the Year.</p>

                    <h3>1998-2002: Change in sound</h3>
                    <p>In early 1999, the band began work on their next album. Tensions were high, band members had
                        different visions for Radiohead's future, and Yorke suffered from writer's block, influencing
                        him toward more abstract, fragmented songwriting.</p>
                    <p>Radiohead's fourth album, <em>Kid A</em>, was released in October 2000. <em>Kid A</em>
                        featured a
                        mimialist and textured style with more diverse instrumentation. It debuted at number one in many
                        countries, including the US. Once again <em>Kid A</em> received a Grammy Award for Best
                        Alertnative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. </p>

                    <h3>2002-present: Legacy</h3>
                    <p>Radiohead has released ground-breaking albums within this time period to critical
                        acclaim, these
                        albums
                        include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Hail to the Thief </em>(2003)</li>
                        <li><em>In Rainbows </em>(2007)</li>
                        <li><em>The King of Limbs </em>(2011)</li>
                        <li><em>A Moon Shaped Pool </em>(2016)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Radiohead has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide since 2011. They were ranked
                        73rd in
                        <em>Rolling Stones's</em> list of "The Greatest Artists of All Time". Five Radiohead
                        albums have
                        been nominated for the Mercury Prize, making Radiohead the most nominated act in the
                        prize's
                        history. Radiohead was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.</p>

                    In order for carousel to automatically transition we use:
